# Read Support Application

## Purpose

This project is intended to be a supplementary tool for reading research papers. The program takes in JPG files of documents (meant to be exported from iPad notes).

The JPG file is then converted to an HSV version of itself, with pink highlighted sections flagged.

From these flagged values, Read Support generates a txt document with only the highlighted sections of text from the original document.

## Planned Features

- Implement more complex notes generation
- Allow for highlight color selection before images are processed
